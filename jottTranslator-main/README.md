# jottTranslator
All of the code needed is in the src folder

To build the project: while in the JottTranslator folder, run `javac src/*.java`

Then you can go into the src folder and run `java Jott input.jott output.<> <language>`

The input.jott file has to be in the src file as well, or you can use `../input.jott` as the filepath
